### Hello, hello üëã

I'm Sabian (SAY-be-in)„Äå„Çª„Éº„Éì„Ç®„É≥„Äç(ÏÑ∏ÎπÑÏï§)

Founder of [Ugeddit](https://ugeddit.com/), chat communities helping people prevent conflict, and be heard

  <summary>About me</summary>
  
  I grew up with a hard-working mom who did a lot for my sake. This made me very complacent in the past, but gave me a lot of freedom to learn and do what I wanted, from gaming, to tech, cyber, sciences, psychology, and more

  Unfortunately, I grew up feeling very alone. My introversion made it hard to approach new people, and my lack of self-awareness and social skills pushed away the people I DID know, but I overcame this, and had a revelation: I wasn't the only one.

  More and more people are going through the same (or worse) isolation, loneliness, and conflict. But as I've been watching the trends, I found the source of these issues is in the communication people are using; the solution is showing people how to refine it, and once we do, every person will be able to not only resolve conflicts quickly and easily, but also grow connection and happy relationships, bringing the world together.

  This is why I started Ugeddit.

*(As of 2023-02-09)*

### What I'm currently working on
- Building Ugeddit's first skill trees for **Social Skills** and **Relationship-building** *(These are specific actions & outcomes that people can use to objectively measure & master their social and people skills)*
- Finding more people to test and share advice on our skill trees to make them more effective and simple; subscribers get extra & personalized help
- Training **Skill Masters** *(people who've mastered at least 1 skill)* who can help out newer people, and get % of subscriber revenue for providing personalized support

### What would help me the most right now
- People willing to test 1 or more items of a skill tree and share their experience
  1. Seeing it for the first time
  1. Understanding its content
  1. Following its steps
  1. Evaluating the outcomes they got from using it
- Someone who enjoys engaging with people, hosting mini-events, challenges, etc to help grow Ugeddit's Discord community

If you know someone who may want to help with either of these (or similar), let me know!
