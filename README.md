# Hey 👋😀 I'm [Sabian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sabianf/) (SAY-be-in)
こんにちは！セイビエンです。  
안녕하세요! 세비앤 입니다.

I'm a Vancouver-born half-Filipino guy who grew up on console games, PCs, and [loves programming, STEM, cognitive science, and more](https://sabfino.com/#what-i-love)

I have 3 passions:
- Understanding how things work
- Making things better
- Uplifting people

And I make damned sure everything I do brings these to life

  <summary>Fun facts about me</summary>

## I...
- Seem to improve at most things even without actively practising them
- Completed 230+ anime series/movies, which includes 4,541+ individual episodes. This does not include dropped series or series I forgot to track
- Watched 45+ movies, and 97+ TV shows, which includes 4,852+ individual episodes. Again, this does not include dropped series or series I forgot to track
- Have listened to probably every piece ever composed by Thomas Bergersen (Two Steps from Hell), Audiomachine, Eternal Eclipse, Jeremy Soule, and David Chappell
- In Shotokan Karate many years ago, went from white belt straight to blue belt (skipping green) in a single exam, earning the fittingly-coloured envy of my green-belted peers
- Experimented with various martial arts from Pankration, to Karate, Krav Maga, Taekwondo (TKD), Brazilian Juujutsu (BJJ), Arnis (FMA, Kali, Eskrima), Historical European Martial Arts (HEMA; medieval weapons), and many others. Overall, my favourites are BJJ and HEMA, but I enjoy them all
- Completely changed as a person at least two entire times since 2019, in terms of self-awareness, mindset, communication skills, business experience, physique, and more
