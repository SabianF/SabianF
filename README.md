# Hey üëãüòÄ I'm Sabian (SAY-be-in)

I'm the founder of [Ugeddit](https://ugeddit.com/), chat communities helping people be heard, and feel connected

<details>
  
  <summary>About me</summary>
  
  I grew up with a hard-working mom who did a lot for my sake. This made me very complacent in the past, but also gave me a lot of freedom to learn and do what I wanted, from gaming, to tech, cyber, sciences, psychology, and more

  I also grew up feeling very alone. My introversion made it hard to approach new people, and my lack of self-awareness and social skills pushed away the people I **did** know, but I overcame this, and learned ways to communicate what I want to say comfortably and effectively, and have people understand me better. I also had a revelation: I wasn't the only one going through this

  More and more people are encountering similar (or worse) isolation, loneliness, and conflict. But, as I've been watching the trends, I determined the source of *all* issues is how people are communicating; the solution is in mastering it, because once they do, people will be able to resolve conflicts quickly and easily, which leads to them growing connection and happy relationships, working together effectively, and bringing the world together
  
  I have 3 passions:
  - Understanding how things work
  - Making things better
  - Uplifting people

  And I make damned sure everything I do brings these to life

  This is why I started [Ugeddit](https://ugeddit.com/)

# What I'm currently doing with Ugeddit
- **Searching for** and reaching out to people who want to improve their social/people skills, relationships, or similar aspects, and asking if want to test our CNC skill tree, so they can see how well it works for them in their real-life situations, and share what happens
- **Being available for** people learning skill trees, so they can quickly become **Skill Masters** *(people who've reached lv3 for in least 1 skill tree)*, so they can get paid to give personalized support and guidance to newer learners
- **Iterating & improving** Ugeddit's first skill trees for **Social Skills** and **Relationship-building** *("Skill Trees" are specific outcomes and actions that people can use to objectively measure & master their real-world skills)*

# What would help Ugeddit the most right now
- **Meeting** more people who want to test our social skills mastery skill tree (CNC) and share their experience
  1. Seeing it for the first time
  1. Understanding its content
  1. Following its steps
  1. Evaluating the outcomes they got from using it
- **Having** someone level up their social skills using CNC to lv3, and becoming a Skill Teacher who gets paid to share their social skills knowledge with new learners
- **Getting to know** someone who enjoys engaging with people, hosting mini-events, challenges, etc who may want to chat about helping to grow Ugeddit's Discord community

If you know someone who may want to help with any of these, I'd be happy if you let them (and me) know!
