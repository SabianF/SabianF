### Hi there 👋

I'm Sabian (SAY-be-in)「セービエン」(새비앤)

Startup founder, tech-nerd, anime-watcher, music-lover, occasional gamer, and more.

I'm currently building my company (and app), Ugeddit on Flutter, NodeJS + Express, and AWS

Right now, where I need the most help is in interacting and engaging with communities, influencers, and people in general; basically someone to be a good Human while talking with people, and mention Ugeddit whenever it's appropriate and makes sense to.

My energy gets drained very quickly when doing this, so someone willing to help will be amazing.

---

Fun fact: I've documented watching over 210 anime series to date
