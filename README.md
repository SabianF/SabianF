### Hi there üëã

I'm Sabian (SAY-be-in)„Äå„Çª„Éº„Éì„Ç®„É≥„Äç(ÏÑ∏ÎπÑÏï§)

Founder of Ugeddit | Cognitive Scientist | World & story builder | Music lover | Martial artist

### What I'm currently working on
- Building Ugeddit's first skill trees for **Social Skills** and **Relationship-building** *(These are specific actions & outcomes that people can use to objectively measure their social and people skills)*
- Finding more people to test and share advice on our skill trees to make them more effective and simple; subscribers will get extra & personalized help
- Training **Skill Masters** *(people who've mastered at least 1 skill)* who can help out newer people, and get % of subscriber revenue for providing personalized support

### What would help me the most right now
- People willing to test 1 or more items of a skill tree and share their experience
  1. Seeing it for the first time
  1. Understanding its content
  1. Following its steps
  1. Getting helpful outcomes from using it

  <summary>Fun facts</summary>

### I...
- Seem to improve at most things even without actively practising them
- Completed 230+ anime series/movies, which includes 4,541+ individual episodes. This does not include dropped series or series I forgot to track
- Watched 45+ movies, and 97+ TV shows, which includes 4,852+ individual episodes. Again, this does not include dropped series or series I forgot to track
- Have listened to probably every piece ever composed by Thomas Bergersen (Two Steps from Hell), Audiomachine, Eternal Eclipse, Jeremy Soule, and David Chappell
- In Shotokan Karate many years ago, went from white belt straight to blue belt (skipping green) in a single exam, earning the fittingly-coloured envy of my green-belted peers
- Experimented with various martial arts from Pankration, to Karate, Krav Maga, Taekwondo (TKD), Brazilian Juujutsu (BJJ), Arnis (FMA, Kali, Eskrima), Historical European Martial Arts (HEMA; medieval weapons), and many others. Overall, my favourites are BJJ and HEMA, but I enjoy them all
- Completely changed as a person at least two entire times since 2019, in terms of self-awareness, mindset, communication skills, business experience, physique, and more
